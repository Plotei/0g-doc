# kv-write

The `kv-write` subcommand writes the user specified key-value pair to the key-value database.

The workflow of KV write is as follows:

1. The user defines the storage node (or indexer) which he/she wants the key-value data to be stored.
2. The user sets the key-value pairs.
3. The SDK will stream the key-value data and encode it to be the same format of a file data.
4. The process is the same as file upload.
5. The KV node will replay the log in on-chain contract, parse out the transaction that operates the KV database. If the KV operation contained in the transaction is legal and there is no version conflict, the update will be committed to the local KV database.

```bash
Usage:
  0g-storage-client kv-write [flags]

Flags:

      --expected-replica uint   expected number of replications to kvWrite (default 1)
      --finality-required       Wait for file finality on nodes to kvWrite
      --indexer string          ZeroGStorage indexer URL
      --key string              Private key to interact with smart contract
      --node strings            ZeroGStorage storage node URL
      --skip-tx                 Skip sending the transaction on chain
      --stream-id string        stream to read/write (default "0x")
      --stream-keys strings     kv keys
      --stream-values strings   kv values
      --task-size uint          Number of segments to kvWrite in single rpc request (default 10)
      --url string              Fullnode URL to interact with ZeroGStorage smart contract
      --version uint            key version (default 18446744073709551615)
```

**Explanation:**

* `--stream-id` is the stream id defined by the user. A stream id can be considered as a separate key-value db. Data in different stream ids do not share with each other. It mainly serves as a channel for various applications. For example, a user can define its own stream id and use that stream as kv database for its own application.
* Use either `--node` or `--indexer` to define the storage location.
* `--stream-keys` and `--stream-values` should match the position of a key-value pair.
* `--version` is the version number for each key to control the parallel access to the key. For example, a user is updating a key `b` using the value from key `a`. While updating, he reads that `a` has version number `10`. Also, during the update, another user is updating `a`, and the version number is updated to `20`. Both transactions are submitted on chain with the tx to update `a` before the tx to update `c`. When the kv instance is replaying the onchain logs, it will first update a and set its version number to `20`. Then when it executes the second transaction, it finds that the version of `a` is `10` which is smaller than `20`. So the second transaction is discarded.
* `--skip-tx` is the flag for skipping tx if the data is already uploaded before (has same data root)

```

From the console output it is shown that the log of the `kv-write` operation is similar to `upload` except that `kv-write` is for key-values pairs while `upload` is for files.
